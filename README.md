Guess what letter the computer is thinking of.

How to play:
The computer will automatically pick a random letter from a-z.  The player will have 13 guesses to get the answer correct.
To play, simply press any letter on the keyboard to take a guess.  If you guess correct, you will be awarded a win and the computer will pick a new letter.
If you guess wrong, the computer will log your incorrect guess.  If you guess incorrectly 13 times, you will be 
awarded a loss and the computer will pick a new letter for you to guess.

Pyschic Game is a javaScript based game that utilizes arrays, assigning variables, loops, on event functions, and pushing text to the web page.
Creating this game was a challange for me, however, I'm happy that I was able to complete it.
